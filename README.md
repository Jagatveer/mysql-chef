Percona Cookbook
=====================
This cookbook is to install and manage Percona MySQL 5.6 with xtrabackup. A good example on how to manage the configurations dynamically.

Requirements
------------
Works with Percona 5.6 as I made an old cookbook public. Will update with the latest version as I have more time

Contributing
------------
TODO: Make it work with the latest percona version

e.g.
1. Fork the repository on Github
2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)
3. Write your change
4. Write tests for your change (if applicable)
5. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass
6. Submit a Pull Request using Github
